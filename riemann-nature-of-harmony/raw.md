THE NATURE OF HARMONY.

TRANSLATED BY J. C. FILLMORE.


The almost inconceivable number of text-books on the subject of harmony
may be divided into two groups: theoretical systems of harmony, and books
intended for teaching the practical use of chords; _i. e._, what are called text-
books on Thoroughbass. Each of these groups contains numerous examples,
but those intended to introduce pupils directly to the practice of part
writing over a figured bass are decidedly more in number than purely
theoretical works, dealing with the significance of chords and their relations
to one another. It has become customary, indeed, in these latter days, to
introduce the practical instruction books with a chapter on theory, or to
begin the separate chapters with some theoretical observations; but, in
principle, the two methods of treating the subject of harmony have to be
kept separate. The practical teaching of harmony, the practice in connect-
ing chords according to the rules of polyphonic writing, is properly a part
of the _art_ of writing music, is the practical acquirement of the technic of
composition. The theory of harmony, on the other hand, is a part of the
_science_ of music; it belongs in the domain of natural science, with which the
art of music has to do only in so far as it can utilize the results of scientific
investigation for its own practical purposes.

Scientific investigation in the domain of music concerns itself, primarily,
with ascertaining the laws which govern _sounding bodies_, and is thus a de-
partment of _physics_; _i. e._, the science of _acoustics_. Then, pursuing tones still
further, and inquiring into the effects they produce on the human ear, and
the mode in which those effects are produced, it becomes a special depart-

ment of _physiology_. Finally, concerning itself with tone-perceptions, with
the _mental effects_ of these acoustic and physiological phenomena, and with
the mental connections and relations of the sensations produced by sound, it
enters the domain of _psychology_. Out of the results of scientific investigation
in all the three fields of physics, physiology and psychology, we get the
elements of an exact theory of the nature of harmony. It is the special
function of this theory to provide, for the practical instruction in the art of
composition, ways and means of grouping special details under general laws;
of establishing comprehensive points of view and general rules; in short, its
province is to systematize facts according to their true nature and laws, and,
avoiding all arbitrary ways of looking at the facts, to provide a true system
as a basis for the practical work of the student and composer.

At first, the contributions to such a theory based on scientific investiga-
tion were few and far between; it is only of late that the impulse given to
scientific study in general has helped us forward considerably. The interest
of practical musicians in the new science is still confined to the few, and has
not yet become intense; but this is hardly to be wondered at when we con-
sider that it is only within the past twenty years that our scientific knowledge
has become sufficient to make it possible to classify discovered facts into a
well-rounded system, available for practical use. The more the new way of
looking at harmonic relations is seen to be positively useful and practical,
the more will interest in laying scientific foundations for the art of music
become widespread and lively. In the following pages I shall briefly show
what benefit the practical teaching of music has already derived from exact
science, and how much it may still hope to draw from such study in wholly
new directions.

The oldest portion of our exact scientific knowledge in connection with
harmony is that investigation into the nature of sounding bodies which
produced _the mathematical definitions of the consonant intervals_. These defi-
nitions are ascribed to Pythagoras; but are, without doubt, much older than
he. The well-known legend about the blacksmith’s hammers of different
weights, which led Pythagoras to the discovery of the relative numerical
proportions of the intervals, is physically false as to its central fact. Py-
thagoras very likely got his facts about intervals, as determined by measur-

---

ing the different lengths of string which produce them, from the Egyptian
priests, with the rest of his philosophy of numbers; at least the elements
of it. 

Of course, the practical musician has a right to ask, “Of what use is it to
Art and artists to know that when two strings sound the interval of an octave,
they being of the same weight and tension, their lengths are related as 1:2;
or if they produce a fifth, as 2:3; or a fourth, as 3:4?” And certainly
the composer derives no _direct_ benefit from knowing these facts; only the
maker of instruments can apply them in his measurements, and the player in
finding out how to stop his strings correctly. But, _indirectly_, we _do_ gain a
great deal from knowing that two tones at the interval of an octave stand in
the simplest of all mathematical relations to each other, and that this simple
relation does (in some as yet unexplained way) make its impression on our
minds; since we really do perceive the octave to be a nearer and simpler
relation of two tones than any other combination whatever. We certainly
ought not to forget that no system of music can be practical which does not
admit of looking at different tones from common points of view; such, for
example, as that which allows us to give the same name to two tones an octave
apart. We should hardly have come to this without the help of mathematics.

The Greeks designated tones an octave apart by the same sign (at least
this is true of their latest notation), discriminating them, however, by a
mark, just as we discriminate the once-marked _c̄_ from small c. The occiden-
tal music system has done the same thing since the tenth, or even since the
ninth century. The fifth and fourth, too, intervals whose relations are only
less simple than those of the octave, play a correspondingly important part
in practice. The key-note, fourth, fifth and octave, are the fundamental
tones of the ancient no less than the modern scales. In the ancient system
they were the only unchangeable tones; the second, third, sixth and seventh
varied with the chromatic and enharmonic modes. I do not need to empha-
size the importance of the fifth in our modern doctrine of keys and chords;
especially in our view of the keys, everything turned on it, up to Moritz
Hauptmann’s time.

The third was not acknowledged at all as a consonance by the ancients.
They did not use our consonant third, related as 4:5; the tone of their 

---

scale which corresponds to our third they defined theoretically as the lower
octave of the fifth four times removed (c-g-d-a-e); and they considered it a
dissonance because of its complicated mathematical relations (64:81). To
the Arabs belongs the merit of having enriched the exact theory of music by
the conception of the consonant third (see my “Studies in the History of
Musical Notation,” pp. 77–85). The so-called “Measure-theory of the
Arabic-Persian theorists, which demonstrates the theory of intervals from a
string divided into twelve equal parts, not only counts the major third (4:5)
and the minor third (5:6) among the consonances, but also the major
sixth (3:5) and the minor sixth (5:8). It looks very much as if their
music was no more exclusively monophonic (_i. e._ in unison), than that of the
Greeks; and as if they must have known the importance of the consonant
chords. The oldest statements of this theory known to us (though they
probably came down from a much older date), belong to the end of the
thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth centuries; _i. e._, to a time
when our Western music had no theoretical conception of the consonant
third; although it had considerably developed the polyphonic style (_discant_,
_Fauxbourdon_). 

The man who first introduced the consonant third into our occidental music
was _Ludovico Fogliani_ (Musica theorica, 1529). He seems not to have been
aware that this was anything new; nor was _Gioseffo Zarlino_, who did the
same thing in 1558, in his “Instituzioni harmoniche.” They both based
their theories on those of the Greek theorists, Didymus and Ptolemy, who,
among other divisions of the fourth (tetra-chord), used the third (4:5)
consisting of a major tone (8:9) and a minor tone (9:10). But although
the Greeks did happen on this third, they never regarded or treated it as a
_consonance; and neither_ Zarlino nor Fogliani had any occasion to disclaim
the originality of their idea.

But Zarlino went further. He gave to the world the conception of _the_ 
_consonant chord, in its double form of major and minor chord_.

In practice musicians had long ago discovered empirically the consonant
harmonies which lie at the foundation of polyphony; but both theory and
practical instruction were totally wanting in the conceptions necessary to
define these formations. Zarlino, in his “Instituzioni” (I. 30 and III, 31),

---

contrasted two modes of dividing a string, which he called the “harmonical”
and the “arithmetical” (Divisione harmonica” and “Divisione aritme-
tica”). By the “harmonical” division of the string he meant the deter-
mining the pitch of the tones produced by the half, third, fourth, fifth and
sixth of the string. By the “arithmetical” division, he meant the deter-
mining of the pitch of _multiples_ of some small fraction of the
string, = 1:2:3:4:5:6. If we take small c as a starting
point, the series of tones represented by the lengths, 1:1/2:1/3:
1/4:1/5:1/6 will correspond to the tones c, c′, g′,
c″, e″, g″; that is to say, tones all of which belong to the
major chord of c. On the other hand, if we start with the
tone g″, the series 1:2:3:4:5:6 will represent the tones
g″, g′, c′, g, e♭, c; that is, tones all of which belong to the minor chord
below g (= c minor). Let us write both out, thus:

In other words: according to Zarlino, _the minor chord is mathematically the_ 
_exact opposite of the major chord_. In fact, he uses the terms “Divisione
harmonica” and “Divisione aritmetica” as meaning major and minor chord
respectively. Whether Zarlino made this happy discovery himself, does not
appear; but I know of no older theorist who has mentioned it. Unfortu-
nately, this splendid idea of Zarlino’s came to naught; whether it remained
unnoticed or whether it was not understood, no matter; it disappeared for
full two hundred years, and was then re-discovered by Tartini.

In all probability, the _thoroughbass_ method, then just coming into vogue
in text-books (although it had been growing into use in the practice of
musicians for a long time before), was mainly responsible for the stifling of
this germ of a rational system of harmony. There was, at that time, no

---

comprehensive nomenclature for even the simplest and most commonly used
chords. If the system which was to grow up had only been developed on
the lines laid down by Zarlino, _i. e._, if his principle of _duality_ had been
recognized, according to which the minor chord is the _reciprocal_, the _counterpart_
and opposite of the major chord; then theory would have taken the direction
in which the latest efforts of theorists are now being put forth; that of a
consistent _dualism_, major being conceived of as formed above the fundamental
tone, and minor _below_ it.* Instead of this, the thoroughbass method took the
lowest voice-part as its invariable starting point, and interpreted all chords
from below upward. 

The Italian organists, who had to accompany choruses in rehearsals and
in public performances, used the figured bass as a convenient abbreviation,
probably as early as the middle of the 16th century. No scores, such as we
have now, were possible then, on account of the peculiar character of the
notation. There were no bars to indicate the measures, and each voice con-
taining notes differing in length from those of the others, had to be separate;
so that playing from score was impossible. There were no scores, either
written or printed; consequently, a conductor or organist who needed to watch
all the voice-parts at once, had to help himself as best he could. The Italians
did it by placing the voice-parts one above another, somewhat after the man-
ner of a score, and then noting over the lowest voice, by means of figures, what
intervals the other voices represented, counting from the bass. The Germans
used another method, which they called the “Organ-tablature.”

In order to comprehend the importance of thoroughbass in the practice
and teaching of musical composition at that time, we nflftst remind ourselves
that all through that period a chord was looked on as a mere accidental
combination of fragments of different voice-parts forming a consonant
interval. As late as 1547, Glarean was of the opinion that a “discant” was
a doubling of several voice-parts moving in different keys, so that, for
example, in the same piece the bass might be in an “authentic” mode, and

\* In my “Studien zur Geschichte der Notenschrift” (Chap. III, “The Revolution from the Conception in
a Minor Sense to that in a Major Sense”), I have shown in detail that the ancients and also the Arabs invari-
ably conceived tone relations from above downward, and that, in the middle ages, this conception was gradu-
ally changed to the reverse, as it is now.

---

the “discant” in a “plagal” mode.* The idea of _naming_ such an acci-
dental combination of tones had not occurred to anybody at that time; it
was foreign to the whole spirit of the time. No one of the combined melo-
dies was looked on as predominant, nor was a bass considered as a foundation
or support for the others; but all were regarded as equally important indi-
vidual melodies, and were invariably thus treated. The first half of the 16th
century is, in fact, the period in which the imitative contrapuntal style
culminated; the second half of the century brings us to the advances made
by Palestrina and Orlandus Lassus, and its end to the beginnings of mono-
phony. It is impossible to avoid the idea that the new conception of the
_chord_, which came just at this time, and the new way of looking at poly-
phonic music which resulted from it, must have had a marked effect on
musical production. 

The thoroughbass system was, as I have just shown, the first attempt at
indicating chords, and its adoption marked a long step forward, both in the
progress of theoretical knowledge and of the practical art of writing. The
essential character of thoroughbass is generally well known. It indicates
each tone by the number which shows its distance above the bass note, in
diatonic degrees. But intervals above an octave are reduced to the lower
octave, thus identifying notes an octave apart; with this restriction, however,
that their relation to the bass note must remain unchanged. As the intervals
are always counted from the bass note, there is no possible way of expressing
the fact that the fifth c-g and the fourth g-c are not exactly the same
interval. Thus, for example, the following chords are indicated in exactly
the same way in the thoroughbass system:—


\* A “discant” was simply a second melody invented to go with a given bass and heard simultaneously 
with it.—Tʀᴀɴsʟᴀᴛᴏʀ.

---

Thus, since the inversions of the intervals
of the upper voices are of no consequence so
far as the figured bass is concerned, there is
no possible way of indicating what interval
any given voice makes with the bass. It can-
not be denied that the thoroughbass system is
an imperfect means of representing harmonies
theoretically ; but it was the first that was found, and was, for that reason
extremely useful.

It was not long before a great many abbreviations came into practical use,
which made it much easier to think harmony. It was soon noticed that the
chord formed out of a third and a fifth occurred much more frequently than
any others. It then became customary to consider this chord as demanded,
unless some other figures were written. This chord thus acquired special
importance. Only when the third or fifth had to be altered by means of a
sharp, flat or natural, was any figure required.

But no distinction was made between a major, minor or diminished 
chord:—

Thus, the figured-bass system became the means of directing the develop-
ment of the theory and practice of harmony into quite other channels than
those marked out by Zarlino, the most learned and distinguished theorist of
his time. The diametrically opposite character of the major and minor
chord was totally forgotten. Then, too, Zarlino’s treatment of chords makes
it perfectly clear that all combinations of the tones c, e and g are, for har-
monic purposes, the same chord; and the same is true of all positions and
inversions of every major or minor chord. But it was impossible to attain
this idea from the standpoint of thoroughbass; indeed, this idea of Zarlino’s
was pushed more and more into the background, for the thoroughbass system
conceived polyphony as a _web of melodies_ rather than a _succession of chords_.
From the standpoint of thoroughbass, _a minor chord is no different from a_ 
_major chord, but an inversion of a major chord is a totally different thing from_ 

---

_the same chord in its fundamental position_. The ideas of Zarlino as to the
essential difference between major and minor chords, and the essential unity
of any given chord, no matter what its inversion or distribution, were
strangled in their birth. The one positive gain was the possibility of indi-
cating all combinations of tones by abbreviations; as, the chord of the sixth
by 6; the chord of the sixth and fourth by 6/4; the chord of the seventh by 7;
the chord of the sixth and fifth by 6/5, etc. That the chord of the sixth is an
inversion of the common chord, and that of the sixth and fifth an inversion
of the chord of the seventh, was not noticed by anybody till 150 years later.
Zarlino’s ideas on this matter had, in the meantime, been wholly forgotten.

After the thoroughbass system got into print, as it did, in the works of
some Italian composers, toward the year 1600, it spread like wild-fire all
over Europe, and soon supplanted the German tablature to a great extent,
because the tablature offered no means of naming chords. Reforms and im-
provements in theory, too, were forced into the background by the rapid rise
of the opera, oratorio and instrumental music, and for more than a century
thoroughbass had full sway, wherever there was an organ or harpsichord
part to be played, whether in church, theatre or concert-hall. The organist
or harpsichordist, and for that matter, the player of the theorbo and viol da
gamba, had no other written part than a figured bass, from which he was
expected to develop a correct polyphonic web of melodies, furnished with
melodic ornaments. Thus it will be seen that thoroughbass playing was, till
past the middle of the last century, a very important art.

There was no further powerful impulse to a more rational development of
theory until 1722, when it came from _Jean Philippe Rameau_,* a man who
also occupies a prominent place in the history of French opera. Rameau is
to be considered as the man who discovered _overtones_. He observed that a
sounding string produced not only its fundamental tone, but the twelfth and
seventeenth above it, the fifth above the octave and the major third above
the double octave. In other words, he noticed that tones which had been
supposed to be simple were really _complex_, made up of several tones; and,

\* “Traité d’harmonie reduite à ses principes naturels.” Rameau wrote a series of works following out 
the ideas of this book. The series was completed in 1760.

---

further, that _these tones are those which form the major chord_. For example,
suppose a string produces the tone c, and also its twelfth, g, and seventeenth,
e′; we have, then, the major chord of c, thus: For a musi-
cian of Rameau’s ability, this discovery was something more
than a curiosity, it was a revelation. It is true the phe-
nomenon of overtones was not wholly unknown before Rameau.
Mersenne (1636) had called attention to them, and Sauveur
(1701) had explained them scientifically, and had emphasized their signifi-
cance in relation to the understanding of the principles of harmony. But
they never became widely known, nor came to any practical importance, as
related to the art of music, until Rameau founded his theory of _fundamental_ 
_basses_ on this phenomenon.

Rameau was too good a musician not to know that to deduce the _major_
consonant chord only from an acoustic phenomenon was not sufficient to
build up a scientific system of harmony. But his attempts to discover a
corresponding phenomenon which should account for the _minor_ consonant
chord, were all in vain. Whether he started out with Zarlino’s _mathematical_
explanation of the opposite principles of major and minor we do not know.
But he did try to find a series of _undertones_ corresponding to the _overtones_,
to account for the minor chord. He discovered that those strings _of which_ 
_a given tone is an overtone_ (_i. e._, according to Rameau, the _under_ twelfth and
seventeenth), will vibrate strongly whenever that string is struck, while
others remain silent. He could not distinguish these tones in the mass, but
he assumed that they must be there, since the strings were in vibration. So
he thought he had discovered in the phenomenon of _sympathetic vibrations_
the principle of the _minor chord_; for the _under_ twelfth and seventeenth of a
note make, with the original note (Rameau’s “generator”), a _minor_ chord; just
as the _over_ twelfth and seventeenth make a _major_ chord, thus:
He _had_ discovered the true principle, but was, unfortunately,
talked out of it by the physicist, D’Alembert, who told him
that the lower strings did not vibrate sympathetically in their
whole length, so as to give their fundamentals, but only in
such fractions as corresponded to the tone of the “generator.” We know
now that these lower strings do vibrate in their whole lengths; although

---

their fundamental tones are much weaker than the partial tones which re-
inforce and correspond to the tone which generates them. (See my “Musik- 
alische Syntaxis,” 1877.)

Thus Rameau had to give up his attempt at a scientific basis for his minor
chord, and was forced to build up his system of harmony one-sidedly, on the
major principle exclusively. So the minor chord came to be regarded as a
modification of the major; as a chord not given in nature; as a less perfect
consonance than the major chord. So that, as it finally turned out, his
physical explanation of consonance was less satisfactory than Zarlino’s
mathematical one. There is only one point in which his system really
brought musical intelligence a long step forward: he first made it clear that
no inversions, transpositions, or changes of distribution of the tones, which
make up a consonant chord, alter its harmonic significance in the least; that
the tones c, e, g, for example, make the chord of c _and nothing else_, however
they may be placed. From the standpoint of thoroughbass, this conception
was unattainable, however near it may seem. By thus doing what thorough-
bass could never have done, by identifying chords which are made up of the
same tones, no matter which of them happens to be in the bass, he invented
the theory of _inversions_ of chords. That was certainly an extraordinary flash
of genius, for it simplified the whole apparatus of harmony at a single stroke.
From thenceforth, the common chord, the 6 chord and the 6/4 chord became
simply different forms of the same chord, and the 7, 6/5, 6/4/3 and 6/4/2, were similarly
identified. This may have been divined before, but it had never been
expressed.

It is very much to be regretted that Rameau was kept back, by d’Alem-
bert, from elaborating his system of harmony on the dual principle. How
fine was his harmonic sense is shown by two further peculiar-
ities of his system: (1) By his conceiving the diminished
chord as a dominant seventh chord with the root omitted,
_e. g._, B-D-F as the chord with G omitted; and (2) by his 
conceiving the chord in C major as the _subdominant_ chord 
with an added sixth, and _not_ as the first inversion of the 
supertonic chord with a seventh, as might have been expected, 
and as is commonly done now. No musician will deny that 

---

the effect of these two chords corresponds to Rameau’s explanation. If the
g were added to the diminished seventh chord, or the d withdrawn from the
other chord, the sense of the harmony would remain the same. Although,
indeed, the chord b-d-f might, in some connections, be conceived as the minor
seventh chord _below_ A, with a omitted. In both these proposi-
tions Rameau divines an idea, to which I shall return, namely
that dissonant chords are to be regarded as modifications of
consonant chords, never as fundamental forms.

Rameau modified the conception of the thoroughbass system in this: that
all _inverted_ chords are to be understood _not_ in the sense of the _bass-tone_, but
as having another tone as root. These roots of inverted chords he called the
“fundamental basses.” But he retained the practice of reading all chords,
whether major or minor, _from below upward_. The following illustration
shows the difference between the thoroughbass system and Rameau’s “funda-
mental basses”:—

These roots made it possible to comprehend the relations of successive har- 
monies, and to discover the laws of harmonic succession. Rameau laid down 

---

the principle that _the fundamental basses ought to progress only by perfect fifths_
(_or fourths_), _or in thirds_ (_major or minor_). If this rule hardly suffices for the
requirements of modern harmony, it contains, at least, the most important
principle of criticism, in that it acknowledges the validity of _third_-relation- 
ships equally with the _fifth_-relationships.

Thus it will be seen that Rameau was rich in suggestions pointing toward
a rational system of harmony. But the adjective “rational” cannot be
applied to his system as a whole. He did, indeed, found the major chord on
a rational phenomenon of acoustics, and his derivation of the diminished
triad and of the major chord with a major sixth, showed great clearness of
perception. But these are isolated phenomena in a scheme which must, in
other respects, be characterized as arbitrary. The system itself would
remain essentially the same if these ideas were subtracted from it. But that
in his system which was really new and peculiar to it was the simplification
of the thoroughbass system by his new doctrine of inversions. This doctrine
had a direct and permanent influence on the future development of har-
mony; we find it adopted in the systems of _Calegari_, who died in 1740
(“Trattato del sistema armonico di F. A. Calegari,” first published by
Balbi in 1829); of _Vallotti_ (“Della scienza teorica e pratica della moderna
musica,” 1779); of _Kirnberger_ (“Die Kunst des reinen Satzes,” 1774-9); of
the _Abbé Vogler_ (“Handbuch der Harmonielehre,” 1802), and of all suc-
ceeding writers. The weak point of Rameau’s system, the inconsistency of
its relations to acoustic science, was very soon remarked. Vallotti gave up
the one-sided attempt to base the major chord on a phenomenon of acoustics,
and developed the _diatonic scale_ from the higher overtones, among which he
found not only the major but the minor chord. D’Alembert, in his “_Elé_-
_ments de musique théorique et pratique, suivant des principes de M. Rameau_,”
(1752), had, in the meantime, pointed out that the overtones noticed by
Rameau, viz., the twelfth and the seventeenth, were not the only ones, but
only the most prominent of a numerous series, which diminished in power
the higher they went. He also called attention to the fact that these over-
tones corresponded to Zarlino’s harmonic divisions of the length of the string
producing them; and that, as regards their vibration-numbers, they stood in
the ratios of the series of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and so -on, thus:—

---

The notes marked with a star are somewhat lower than the corresponding notes of our tempered system.


Vallotti found the scale between the eighth and sixteenth overtones, the
major chord in 4:5:6, and the minor chord in 10:12:15. But this did
not account for the _consonance_; this element consists, according to Rameau,
in the fact that we conceive the tones of the chord as _belonging_ to the funda-
mental; g and e′ are consonant with c because they _resolve_ or find their
point of repose in it. But we cannot conceive e″, g″, b″, as belonging to c
without destroying the consonance.

Kirnberger accepted the overtones as an explanation of the major conso-
nant chord; paid no attention to the inconsistency involved in not carrying
it out further; gave up Rameau’s explanation of the diminished triad and of
the major chord with an added sixth, and held to the thoroughbass system
of figuring the inversions. He saw no need of any alterations in the system;
he regarded the major, minor and diminished triads as equally justified and
well-founded, and he accepted, besides, these four kinds of seventh-chords as
normal harmonies, viz., major chords with major and minor sevenths, and
minor and diminished chords with minor sevenths. Kirnberger’s system has
maintained itself in practical instruction books, with no essential modifica-
tions, to the present day. _Since Rameau, the sole criterion for distinguishing_ 
_normal chords, inversions and suspensions has been the_ ꜰᴏʀᴍᴀᴛɪᴏɴ ʙʏ ᴛʜɪʀᴅs;
_i. e._, chords which form a series of thirds above the bass note have been
regarded as normal; those which are formed in the same way, but have some
other tone than the root in the bass, have been regarded as inversions; and,
finally, those which could not be resolved into a series of thirds have been
regarded as accidental formations,—as suspensions. This building up of
thirds into chords was carried beyond sevenths, to ninths, elevenths and
thirteenths, although they had to be used, practically, in elliptical forms.
J. H. Knecht, especially, carried these monstrous chords to extremes; but
there was soon a reaction from this, and the chord of the ninth became the

---

extreme limit of the chords acknowledged as normal; even this being
coupled with certain conditions.

I have already mentioned that Tartini, the renowned violinist, revived
Zarlino’s idea of the dual nature of harmony, after two hundred years of
oblivion.*

It is not impossible that Tartini had thoroughly studied and understood
Zarlino; he not only bases the major chord on the harmonic, and the minor
chord on the arithmetical division of the string, but he sees in the minor
chord _not another kind of third_; _i. e._ not a _minor_ third, as the thoroughbass
system does, but only a _changed position of the major third_. In the major
chord the major third is _above_ the principal tone; in the
minor chord it is _below_ it; the fifth being here regarded
as principal tone, thus:—

But Tartini was a contemporary of Rameau’s, and so could not simply
occupy Zarlino’s standpoint. The question of basing consonance on acoustic
principles, which Rameau had raised, excited lively interest in his mind, and
he discovered new aspects of it. To be sure, he did not carry the attempt to
account for the minor chord beyond pointing out that it is the polar opposite
of the major, in the sense of Zarlino’s “arithmetical” and ”harmonical”
division of a string; but he enlarged the conception of the major chord, by
refusing to ignore, as other theorists did, the fact that the series of overtones
does not stop with the sixth. The seventh overtone (a trifle lower than the
seventh of our tempered system) is commonly regarded as a dissonance; but
Tartini affirmed, quite consistently, that the major chord with a natural
seventh is a _consonance_. This opinion is shared by no less an authority in
exact acoustic science than Helmholtz.

As a matter of fact, both are correct, if we take into account only _physi_-
_cal euphony_, _i. e._ the blending of the tones without disturbance. Indeed,
the major chord of our tempered system is less consonant, if this test alone
be adopted. But whether even the natural seventh chord, having the pro-
portions 4:5:6:7, is a _musical_ consonance or not, is another question.†

In such matters Art cannot accept the decisions of Science as final or con-
clusive. A few decades later than Tartini, Kirnberger and Fasch, in Berlin,
also tried to utilize the natural seventh for practical musical purposes, but
with small success. For, of course, we can hardly use an imtempered sev-
enth with a tempered third and fifth ; and nobody has proposed to use the
natural seventh in our system as a fundamental (dissonant) interval, without
being tempered like the rest.

Tartini is also well known as the discoverer of the _Combination_ (or result-
ant) _tones_, which were named, after him, “The Tartini tones.” It is true his
“Trattato” was first published in 1754, while Sorge had called attention to
the combination-tones in his “Vorgemach musikalischer Komposition,”
published in 1740; but Tartini discovered them as early as 1714; and when
he opened his violin school in Padua, in 1728, he made them the test of the
correct intonation of chords. (Compare my “Studien zur Geschichte der
Notenschrift,” 1878, page 101.) The phenomenon of combination-tones, as
Tartini correctly observed, coincides with that of overtones, to this extent.
When two tones sound together, the lower (combination) tones which are
audible are no other than the tones of the overtone series in which the tones
of the original interval would be designated by the smallest ordinal numbers.
The series extends downward to the fundamental or generator. Tartini
made only an imperfect investigation of the series of combination tones, as
did Rameau of the overtones. He only heard the lowest resultant tone, the
fundamental tone of the series; and at first (in his “Trattato,”) he located
it an octave too high; but in his later book “De principj,” he gave it its
correct position. We know now that the whole overtone series of this fun-
damental tone can be heard, not only the tones below the given interval, but
those which correspond with it, and the higher ones, so that the relationship
of the two phenomena is evident enough. The fifth 2:3 (c-g) gives only
one combination-tone, that which corresponds to 1, namely, the octave below
the lower tone of the interval (C). The fourth 3:4 (g-c′) makes 1 and 2
(C-c) audible; the third 4:5 (c′-e′) the tones 1, 2 and 3 (C-c-g), etc.
_These deeper resultant tones are of especial importance in comprehending the_ 
_major chord; they furnish the only true scientific basis for the explanation of_ 
_inversions;_ since the chord c′-e-g′, the first inversion (6 chord) e′-g′-c″

---

and the second inversion (6/4 chord), g-c′e′ 
find their common point of union in 
the resultant tone C, thus:— 

Chords.

Deep result- 
ant tones. 

But the typical form of the major 
chord is not
the close po-
sition,but the
open one—

There is another kind of combination (or resultant) tones which did not
receive adequate attention until very lately, namely, the _coincident overtones_
(A. von Oettingen, Harmonie-system in dualer Entwickelung, 1866). Among
the higher tones of an interval or chord (_i. e._, the overtones of the separate
tones of the chord, and the combination-tones of the overtones), _the first com_-
_mon overtone_ of the tones of the chord is most distinctly audible. Its ordi-
nal number may be found by multiplying together the ordinal numbers of
tones of the intervals in the series of overtones. For this reason it may be
called the _multiple-tone_. Thus the major third 4:5 (c′-e′) has the multiple
tone 4×5=20 (e‴); the major sixth 3:5 (g-e′) has 3×5=15 (C″); the
minor third 5:6 (e′-g′) has 5×6=30 (b‴). As the minor third e′-g′ (or the
major sixth g-e′) becomes a major chord by the addition of the _combination_- 
_tone_ C, so by the addition of the _multiple-tone_ b″ (or b‴) either becomes a
minor chord. A. von Oettingen (Professor of Physics at the University of
Dorpat) sees in the multiple-tone, or, as he calls it, the ”phonic overtone,”
_the natural bond of the minor chord_. Thus b‴ is the common overtone of the 
following series of tones:—

(The tones marked with a * are all slightly higher than the corresponding tones of the tempered system.)

Here, then, we have the complete _undertone series_; a series of precisely
the same fundamental importance as regards the minor chord that the over-
tone series is as regards the major chord. The tones of this series blend into

---

perfect unity in their relation to the highest tone of the series, exactly as the
tones of the overtone series do in relation to their fundamental. How our
musical perception deals with those tones of the series which do not belong
to the minor chord of e (7, 9, 11, 13, 14, etc.) I have already explained
above, in connection with the corresponding tones of the overtone series.

But as we do not account for the major chord by the combination-tones
alone, but regard the phenomenon of overtones as the real explanation of it,
so, in order to explain the minor chord to our perfect satisfaction, we require
a corresponding _phenomenon_ of undertones, to set over against the overtones.
Although such a phenomenon has not yet been sufficiently well established
to be perfectly satisfactory, there are not wanting signs that minor chords are
perceived by the mind as sustaining the same relations when reckoned from
above downward, that the major chords do when reckoned from below up-
ward. I have already pointed out that the phenomenon of _sympathetic vibra_- 
_tions_ gives us the series of undertones. The phenomenon of _jarring_ tones
belongs to the same category. If a tuning-fork in vibration be set lightly
(not firmly) on a sounding board, or if a loosely-fastened metallic plate be
set violently vibrating, we hear, _not the fundamental tone_ of the plate or fork,
but its under octave, under twelfth, even the under double octave, under
seventeenth, of other low undertone. But it is indeed probable that every
tone _always_ generates not only a series of _overtones_, but a series of _undertones_
also, decreasing in power in the direct ratio to their depth, and more difficult 
to detect and separate from the mass of tones in our consciousness than are
the overtones. I have diligently collected all possible information on this
point, so far as the facts have been observed, and I find nothing inconsistent
with this hypothesis. (See my “Musikalische Logik,” 1873, p. 12; “Die
objective existenz der undertöne in der Schallwelle,” 1875, printed separately
from the “Allgemeine Deutsche Musikzeitung;” “Musikalische Syntaxis,”
1877, preface and appendix, and the article on “Untertöne” in my ”Musik-
Lexikon.”)

But whatever any one may think of this or that opinion of mine, thus much
remains certain: _The major and minor chords are, as regards their mathemat_- 
_ical and acoustical relations, the polar opposites of each other_. The further
question is, whether the physiology of hearing, and the psychology of musical

---

perception find a similar reciprocity of major and minor intelligible, and
whether they can recognize this mathematico-physical principle as valid for
them also. 

The physiology of tone sensations has only lately been thoroughly inves-
tigated, mainly by the distinguished physicist and physiologist, Helmholtz.*
This book is not devoted exclusively to physiological investigations, as
might, perhaps, be inferred from its title, but comprehends the whole domain
of exact science as related to tone, from the production and conveyance of
tone on to the mental correlation of tone representations. That is to say,
it is largely occupied, on the one hand, with mathematical and physical
investigation, and on the other, it extends to the field of psychology and
aesthetics.

Thus, the theory of overtones and combination-tones is treated in detail,
and differences in tone-color (_timbre_) are explained as the result of different
combinations of overtones in the complex tones we hear. These investiga-
tions are invaluable, especially as regards the theory of the construction of
instruments. They explain, for example, the mixture stops of the organ,
which were in practical use long before the tones of pipes were known to be
complex, showing that the auxiliary ranks of pipes merely reinforce the over-
tones which make up the chord of the fundamental, and thus strengthen its
impression.

The physiological chapters in Helmholtz’s book are (1) those which treat
of the faculty possessed by the ear of analyzing complex tones, of separating
such tones into their component elements, although they reach the ear as a
single vibration-form; (2) that which treats of the perception of differences
of tone-color (timbre), which rests on the same principles; and (3) that on
the comparative euphony of the different kinds of chords. Fine and intelli-
gent as are the investigations and observations on the first two problems,
they can only be considered as hypothetical, and Helmholtz himself so con-
siders them. His hypothesis is, that there is in the ear a complicated
apparatus of more or less tense nerve fibres of different lengths; that these
are set in vibration by sound waves, according to the laws of sympathetic

4th Auflage, 1877). There is an English translation of this work.—Tʀᴀɴsʟᴀᴛᴏʀ.

---

vibrations, and communicate these to the auditory nerve. The whole appa-
ratus is of microscopic dimensions. This hypothesis has not yet been pro-
ductive of any positive results as regards the theory of music. Indeed, it is
not yet wholly beyond doubt whether it means positive results even in the
field of natural science.

But the most vulnerable chapter of Helmholtz’s book is that on the nature
of consonance and dissonance. These conceptions Helmholtz seeks to explain
from the standpoint of physiology, as consisting merely in differences of
euphony. He thinks dissonance consists in the presence of “beats,” _i. e._, in
the regular and rapid recurrence of reinforcements of tone, producing dis-
turbance. (See Tyndall, on Sound, or any book on Acoustics, Tʀ.) Conso-
nance he defines as consisting in the absence of beats, or in the reduction of
them to a minimum. The major chord is more nearly free from beats than
any other; the minor chord has more elements which disturb the consonance
from a physiological point of view. Starting with the major
chord, as shown in the relations of the first six overtones,
which offers fewest disturbances, there can be established a
regularly diminishing scale of euphony, measured by the
standard of beats, down to the harshest dissonances, and the discords most
unavailable for musical purposes. So that, on his principles, neither major
and minor consonances nor consonances and dissonances have any other
characteristic distinction than a difference of degrees of euphony.

This result is very unsatisfactory, and has already been violently contro-
verted. Professor Arthur von Oettingen especially, in his “Harmonic-
system in dualer Entwickelung” (1866), insisted that there must be a radical
difference in principle between major and minor. This difference he found
in conceiving the one form of consonance as the polar opposite of the other.
That is, he construed the minor consonance as the direct antipode of the
other, in the mode already explained; and he carried out this contrast con-
sistently in his doctrine of scales and chords. He pointed out the truth that
the minor consonance is not in the least inferior to the major consonance in
euphony, when we consider it as resulting from the _undertone_ series, just as
the major consonance results from the _overtone_ series. The minor chord is

---

just as free from beats as the major chord given above; and
blends just as perfectly into a unity, the central point of which
is the _highest_ tone. There is, to be sure, the common resultant
tone F, to disturb the consonance, but over against this we
must set the disturbance of the coincident overtone b‴, pro-
duced by the major chord in the position given above. Von Oettingen also
pointed out a way for the discrimination of consonance and dissonance—a
way in which we may reach satisfactory results. But this way leads us from
the domain of physiology into that of psychology.

With great intellectual acuteness, the able Göttingen philosopher, Her-
mann Lotze (Geschichte der Aesthetik in Deutschland, 1868), discovered
the Achilles-heel of the Helmholtz system. Like von Oettingen, he insisted
on a difference of principle between major and minor, and between conso-
nance and dissonance. He even thought the difference between different
kinds of dissonances must be something more than difference in degrees of
euphony. Since then a number of musico-theoretical writings have been
published, in which those points of Helmholtz’s doctrine criticised by von
Oettingen and Lotze have been attacked from different standpoints. These
writings take von Oettingen’s well-nigh complete system as a starting-point
for further investigation, and seek to solve those problems which are still
doubtful.* 

I have thus far said nothing of Moritz Hauptmann, whose epoch-making
work, “Die Natur der Harmonik und der Metrik,” was published in 1853;
but this was because I wished to do full justice to his merits. This I can
now do without interruption. Hauptmann was at the same time a man of
high musical gifts and a profound philosophic thinker. The idea of _dualism_
in harmony, of the diametrically opposite nature of major and minor, which
two of the ablest among the older theorists discovered on the line of mathe-
matical construction, he rediscovered on the line of philosophical speculation,
long after the works of those two writers, on the dusty shelves of old libra-
ries, were sleeping the sleep of eternal oblivion. Hauptmann’s memorable

Logik,” and ”Musikalische Syntaxis,” as well as my “Skizze einer neuen Methode der Harmoniclehre,” (1880).

discovery that the minor chord ought to be regarded as a major chord upside
flown, developed negatively instead of positively, made a great sensation.
Of course, when we now find, in studying the history of harmony teaching,
that the same discovery had been made by Tartini a hundred years before
and by Zarlino three hundred years earlier, we cannot give Hauptmann the
credit of its first discovery; historically it is not a new idea. But it would
be very unjust to Hauptmann to deny him the merit of having discovered it
for himself. So far as the present and future development of theory is con-
cerned, Hauptmann is the originator of the idea. It did not occur to any
of the theorists of our time, any more than to those of the first half of the
century, to go back to Zarlino or Tartini for wisdom in these matters. The
idea came to all of us from Hauptmann. There are his own faithful pupils,
Köhler, Paul, and Rischbieter, who hold to the letter of his teaching.
O. Tiersch, who seeks a compromise between Hauptmann and Helmholtz
(see his “System und Methode der Harmoniclehre,” 1868); then the strictly
consistent dualists, von Oettingen, Thürlings, myself, and with some reserva-
tions, Hostinsky, who have become more Hauptmannish than Hauptmann
himself—all of us received the idea of dualism in harmony as a new concep-
tion from him. I myself brought to light the fact that there had been
previous advocates of this idea; as regards Tartini, in my pamphlet, “Die
objective Existenz, etc.,” published in 1875, and as regards Zarlino, in the
article “Zarlino als harmonischer Dualist,” published in the “Monatshefte
fur Musikgeschichte,” in the year 1881.

Hauptmann’s system influenced Helmholtz’s very strongly, although he
has never accepted the principle of dualism in harmony, and even now
maintains, at most, a passive attitude with reference to it. The evidence of
this is to be found in Part III of his “Tonempfindungen,” on “Chord Affini-
ties.” This is the most valuable part of his book, as regards music. In this
part one feels everywhere that Hauptmann’s fundamental principle—“there
are three directly intelligible intervals: I, the Octave; II, the Fifth; III,
the Major Third” (Natur der Harmonik und der Metrik, p. 21)—underlies
the whole. This is a great and epoch-making conception, and implies every-
thing which exact science has discovered since. Hauptmann makes no
account of minor thirds, fourths, sixths, or any other intervals. To his

---

mind, they have no independent existence or significance; they are only =
products, combinations of the fundamental conceptions, octave, fifth, third.
It must be confessed that even this was not absolutely new ; mathematicians
had known for centuries that all possible musical intervals could be expressed
as products and powers of the numbers 2, 3, 5. The ancient theory recog-
nized only two fundamental intervals: the octave and the fifth. All other
intervals it derived from these. Thus, the second (c-d) was the second fifth
(c-g-d) reduced to the lower octave; the third was a lower octave of the
fourth fifth (c-g-d-a-e), etc. Since Fogliani and Zarlino established the
consonance of the third, that interval has been taken into account in all
occidental music. The major seventh (c-b), for example, is defined as the
third of the fifth (c-g-b); the augmented fourth (c-f♯) as the third of the
second fifth (e-g-d-f♯); the augmented fifth (c-g♯) as the third of the
third, etc. But it was Hauptmann through whom the recognition of these
facts passed into the text-books on harmony.

It was Hauptmann who invented a notation (letters, not notes), by means
of which he could distinguish tones related by fifths from those related by
thirds. In this notation, two tones of the same name, but differing by the
so-called “Didymic,” or “syntonic comma,” were indicated, the one by a
capital and the other by a lower-case letter. As above mentioned, Didymus
had a tetrachord,         in which there were two kinds of whole-tones,
one having the ratio 10:9, and the other 9:8. The difference of the two
ratios (10/9:9/8) is the “Didymic comma,” 80:81.

In our major scale, the whole tone c-d has the ratio 8:9, (d is the second
fifth of c, _i. e._, (3/2)^2=9/4, reduced to the lower octave, 9/8), and the whole tone
d-e has the ratio of 9:10, (e is the third of c; _i. e._, 5/4, and d:e=9/8:5/4=40/36
=10/9. This third e (5/4) differs from the e which is a lower octave of the
fourth fifth by 80:81. For the fourth fifth (c-g-d-a-e)=(3/2)4=81/16;
reduced to the lower octave, 81/64. The true third, 5/4=80/64. Ratio of the
two thirds, 80:81. Hauptmann uses a capital C for the note which was his
original starting point; the true third he indicates with a small e, and uses
a capital E for the tone produced from the series of fifths. Everywhere in
his notation capital letters indicate a series of fifths; intervals represented

---

by large and small letters alternately are thirds; those represented by small
letters form a series of fifths with one another, thus:—



Hauptmann represents the key as made up of the three chords, Tonic,
Dominant, and Subdominant, thus:—

F a C e G b D

Here we have the two series of fifths, F-C-G-D and a-e-b; the one made up
of tones related to c by fifths, and the other by thirds. The most important
point in this treatment of the subject is the recognition of _third-relationship_
in tones and in keys. Even Marx wondered that the keys of E major and 
A major are directly intelligible after C major, while D major and B♭ major 
sound foreign and unrelated after it. Marx knew nothing of third-relation-
ship, and was naturally astonished that the key of the fourth fifth in the
series should seem more closely related than that of the second fifth. But
e major is not the key of the fourth fifth, but the key of the third.
Although Beethoven, in his sonata in C, Op. 53, wrote his second subject
in E major (first movement), Hauptmann was the first who clearly pointed
out the third-relationship of keys, and thus solved the problem once for
all. Since that time the idea of the third-relationship of keys as equally
valid with the fifth-relationships has got itself fairly established in the
later music; although many theorists, of the sort who hold rigidly to
ancient traditions and are impervious to such discoveries of genius as
this of Hauptmann’s, still look on it as something abnormal, or, at best,
barely allowable.

Hauptmann’s letter notation distinguishing the third-related from the fifth-
related tones has been improved by Helmholtz and von Oettingen so as to

---

distinguish underthirds and overthirds; thirds related in the first from those 
related in the second degree, and so on, thus:—



Instead of using large and small letters, the mark — is invariably used to
indicate the comma (80:81). Thus e̲ is a comma lower than e; a̅♭̅ is a
comma higher than a♭ ; c̳♯̳ is two commas lower than c♯, etc.

But Helmholtz not only grasped Hauptmann’s theory in all its compre-
hensiveness and placed it on a scientific basis (leaving out of sight his un-
satisfactory explanation of the minor chord and of the difference between
consonance and dissonance), but he developed it further by a new concep-
tion, that of _chord substitution_, a conception which has opened wholly new
perspectives. All theorists may have divined that we conceive of single
tones as substitutes or representatives of chords, but no one else had ever
said so. With Helmholtz, all complex tones are overtone combinations, _i. e._
major chords. The minor chord c-e♭-g, he conceived as a compound of
two major chords, those of c and e♭. Hostinsky follows him in this and
even goes further. But von Oettingen has widened the range of this concep-
tion of Helmholtz to an unexampled degree, by treating the minor chord as
a real chord which may lie represented in the mind when only one of its tones
is present. In this view, the principle of chord substitution (or representation
in the above sense) is no longer a principle of acoustics or Physiology but of
Psychology. If we really find by experience that we are able to conceive a 
tone as representing a minor chord just as easily as a major chord, neither
chord being audibly present, then that is a scientific fact on which we may
build quite as well as we can on acoustic phenomena. When we have once
acknowledged this, it seems of very little account whether the minor chord

---

can be based on acoustic facts or not. The psychological fact that we con-
ceive single tones in the sense of chords remains. We can imagine any
given tone as representing three major and three minor chords; we can
think of it as principal tone, third or fifth of either a major or minor chord.
It is no more difficult for us to imagine a given e, for example, as principal
tone of its under-chord (a-c-e), or as under-fifth of the under-chord of f
(e-g-b), or as third of the under-chord of g♯ (c-e-g♯), than it is to imagine
it as root of its over-chord (e-g♯-b) or as fifth of an over-chord (a-c♯-e) or
as third of c over-chord, (c-e-g). There are no other chords for which we
can use the tone e as a substitute or representative in imagination. Where-
ever else it occurs, it must be a dissonaut, disturbing element; _e. g._ as seventh
in the chord of f♯ major, as an added sixth to the chord of g major, etc.

This latest advance in scientific knowledge has transformed the science of
Harmony from a doctrine of the mathematical relations of musical inter-
vals to a doctrine of mental tone-representations and their connections.
Acoustics and the physiology of hearing are remanded to their proper place
of auxiliary sciences, the place which belongs to them, and which they have
always occupied in the estimation of musicians. It is a revolution which
the musician is glad to see, for he is familiar with mental representations of
tones and chords, and he instantly comprehends a theory based on them, as
soon as its terminology is familiar; while he feels a great gulf fixed between
the calculations of the physicist, or the nerve affections of the physiologist
on the one hand, and his musical conceptions on the other. This very gulf
separates Parts II and III of Helmholtz’s “Lehre von der Tonempfindungen.”
Part III is clear and lucid, full of genuine musical intelligence; Part II
strives in vain to connect itself with real music, and its sole result is the above
mentioned imperfect explanation of consonance and dissonance.

The mistake which Helmholtz made, is now easy to recognize. He tried
to explain from the nature of sounding bodies conceptions which can only
be explained from the nature of the perceiving mind. Consonance and dis-
sonance are _musical_ conceptions—not definite forms of sound-waves. But it
must not be forgotten that the recognition of this truth was only possible
after long-continued investigations in physics and physiology. It was neces-
sary first to make clear that physics and physiology could never suffice as a

---

foundation for musical conceptions, before psychology could take its rightful
place. We know now that there are no _absolute_ consonances; that a com-
bination of tones acoustically and physiologically free from disturbing
elements, may nevertheless be a _dissonance_, musically speaking. The 6/4
chord is an example.

Lest I extend this sketch beyond reasonable limits, I must be brief now,
and can only indicate in outline the form impressed on the doctrine of 
Harmony by the conception of chord substitution. 

As long as a tone seems to have no definite relation to a chord, we have
in the mind only the simple representation of a single tone; the idea is
empty and unsatisfactory; it embraces at most only the lower and upper
octaves of the single tones in addition to it. But we very seldom think tones
in this unrelated way. When a piece begins with a single tone, we are apt to
think of it as principal tone of a chord, either major or minor. But the
harmonic sense of an _interval_ is much more definite. A single tone may be
conceived of as occupying any one of six different relations; but a conso-
nant interval can only be thought in _two_. Thus c-g must be conceived as
representing either c over-chord or g under-chord. It cannot belong to any
other consonant chord; and we do not naturally conceive it as a dissonance
unless some tone or tones are added which belong to a different chord.

But even the idea of a consonant chord is not _final_, but is capable of
further definition. If we imagine the chord of C major, as belonging in the
key of F major, or G major, or C major, the chord is conceived differently in
each case. Helmholtz rightly observed (Tonempfindungen, 4th edition, p.
471) that a chord, in order to close a piece satisfactorily, must be not merely
a _consonant_ chord, but the _tonic_ chord. But when Helmholtz goes on to say
that former theorists have not been perfectly clear on this point, I must
except Tartini, who, in his _Trattato_ (p. 112), insists that all the tones of a
key are dissonances except those which belong to the tonic chord. In other
words, _the only consonant chord_ in any key, in the strictest sense of the term,
_is the tonic chord_. That is, the tonic is the only chord which can be used for
the final point of repose; the only one which does not distinctly require a
further progression. In c major, it is the chord c-e-g; in g major, g-b-d;
in a minor, a-c-e, etc. In c major, the chord of g is not a perfect conso-

---

nance; as is proved by this fact alone, viz., that the seventh, f, can be added
to it without any essential change in its harmonic significance, or even of its
acoustic relations. Nor is the chord of F major a true consonance in the 
key of C; and a major sixth (d) may be added to it without any essential
change in the mental effect. The effect of these chords is _dissonance-like_; or
better, the perception of them contains something which disturbs their con-
sonance; and this something is simply their _relation_ to the chord of C major.
For to think a chord in the sense of a certain key is to understand it as
related to another chord; just as to think a tone in the sense of a certain 
chord is to conceive it not as isolated, but as related to a principal tone, or
as principal tone itself in its relation to the others. When I imagine the
chord of c major as in the _key_ of c major, then it is itself tonic, centre, point
of repose; the idea of it involves nothing contradictory, nor any element
which disturbs its consonance; it is simple, pure, reposeful. But when I
imagine the chord of g major as in the key of c, then I think of it as the
chord of the over-fifth of the chord of c; that is to say, _the chord of c major_
_forms a part of the conception_, as being the chord which determines the
significance of the chord of g—the chord from which the g chord is distin-
guished, and to which it is related. The central point of the idea, so to
speak, _lies outside_ of the chord of g; there is in that chord an element of
unrest; we feel it necessary to go on to the chord of c as the only satisfactory
point of repose. This element of dissatisfaction constitutes dissonance.

It is just so with the chord of F major, and with every other chord of the
key. This modern conception of key, or _tonality_, as we have come to call it,
to distinguish it from the old idea of key, is not confined to the scale. We
can imagine chords containing tones outside of the scale as being intimately
related to the tonic chord. This is especially true of the (major) chords of
the major third above and below the tonic (in c major, the chords of e major 
and a♭ major), and also of the minor third above and below (in C major, e♭ 
major and a major).

The idea of tone relationship may be extended to the relation of keys to
one another. As the principal tone of a chord is related to its accessory
tones (the third and fifth, and more distantly related tones), and as the tonic
chord in a key is related to the accessory chords (chords of the fifths, thirds,

---

etc.), so the principal key of a piece is related to the accessory keys which
occur in it (the key of the fifth above and below, the third above and below,
etc.). In a piece in c major, the _key_ of g major plays much the same part
that a _chord_ of g major does in a short cadence in the key of c, or that the
tone of g does in an arpeggio on the chord of c, or that the tones b and d do
in the scale of c. That is, the effect in all these cases is _dissonant_; it has
no justification in itself, independent of its relation to something else ; its
justification is _conditioned_, said it can lay no claim to permanent duration.

Thus the fundamental laws of chord succession, as well as of the succession
of keys (Modulation) may be deduced directly from the extension of these
simplest musical conceptions, consonance and dissonance. Psychology
teaches us that different conceptions cannot maintain themselves at the same
time in consciousness on a footing of equality; one must dominate, and the
others will seem to contradict or disturb it. This doctrine proves true in the
fullest sense in the case of musical ideas; it furnishes the data for a true 
definition of consonance and dissonance, such as the physicists and physiolo-
gists in vain attempt to formulate. By means of it we discover not only the
difference in principle between consonance and dissonance, but also the
qualitative difference between the different kinds of dissonances which Lotze
demanded.

Consonance is the perception of unity in the relation of the tones which
make up a chord. Dissonance is the perception of want of unity in the
chord; of the presence of elements belonging to other chords which disturb
the unity, which contradict the main sense of the chord. The two or more
chords which are always represented in a dissonant chord are not _coördinate_
in it, but one of them is chief, and the rest modify it. This modification will
differ, of course, according to the various relations of the chords rej)resented.
The experience of centuries has established that the tonic chord in a key
can only be a major or a minor chord. This we may easily confirm at any
time by psychological experiment, and must, therefore, regard it as a natural
law. No diminished chord, chord of the seventh, or any kind of dissonance
can possibly serve as principal chord of a key. It is strange, therefore, that
theorists did not long ago arrive at the conclusion that dissonant chords are
_never intelligible in and of themselves_, but must always be understood _in the_

_sense of a consonance_. This is true whether the dissonance consists in adding
a dissonant tone to a consonant chord, as in chords of the seventh, sixth and
ninth; in the substitution for a tone belonging to the chord, of a foreign tone
which leads to it, as in the case of suspensions ; or in the chromatic alteration
of a note of a chord, for the purpose of leading up to a tone of the succeeding
chord (altered chords). Instead of looking upon discords as mere modifica-
tions of concords, theorists to this day regard discords as independent chord
formations, equally well founded and justifiable with the major and minor
concords. The blame for this belongs to Kirnberger, who failed to under-
stand and carry out Rameau’s notions as to discords being derived from
concords, and stuck to the old chord classification of the thoroughbass
system, which could not possibly be accommodated to the needs of progress
in harmonic intelligence.

If the theory of harmony, which I have here sketched, should ever be fully
worked out into a complete system, then the study of harmony will become
a real exercise in music-thinking. The simple will, of itself, point the way
to the more complex, and will stimulate the learner boldly to venture on the
new, rather than, as heretofore, to _seek_ the new. In my “Musical Syntax,”
and my “Sketch of a New Method of Teaching Harmony,” I have attempted
a detailed system. Especially in the former, I have tried to establish com-
prehensive points of view for the construction of complete harmonic wholes.
But in closing I wish to emphasize once more, that however much may be
found new in the external apparatus of my presentation, in machinery or
treatment, the leading points of view, the fundamental ideas, are not to be
credited to me. So far as they cannot be referred back to older theorists,
especially to Rameau, they belong to the three greatest promoters of intelli-
gence, as regards the essential nature of harmony: Moritz Hauptmann,
Heinrich Helmholtz and Arthur von Oettingen.
